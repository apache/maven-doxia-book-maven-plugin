Introduction

 Doxia allows you to write books like user manuals and guides in any format supported by Doxia. Combined with the
 Doxia Book Maven Plugin, you are able to include the manuals directly in your generated site with links to the off-line
 friendly formats like XDoc, PDF, RTF and LaTeX.

* Goals Overview

 The Doxia Maven Plugin has one goal:

 * {{{./render-books-mojo.html}doxia:render-books}} to create books in different output formats.

 []

 First you need a simple book descriptor which is used to specify the layout of your book, i.e.
 the ordering of the sections and the names for the chapters.
 See {{{http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia-tools/doxia-book-renderer/book.html}The Book Descriptor Reference}}
 for a reference to the descriptor.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Doxia Book Maven Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/PDF+Plugin}plugin's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.

* Examples

 An Xdoc output example which has been rendered into this site can be viewed {{{http://maven.apache.org/doxia/doxia-example-book/index.html}here}}.
